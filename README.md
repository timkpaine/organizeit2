`OrganizeIt2` is a python library for managing large numbers of files and directories. It is type- and configuration-driven with [pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/).

The name is because `organizeit` was [taken on pypi](https://pypi.org/project/organizeit/), and is thus a reference to the [joke from Parks and Rec](https://parksandrecreation.fandom.com/wiki/The_Reasonabilists).


## Overview

`OrganizeIt2` has the following models and types:

- `FileSystem`: `pydantic` wrapper of an `fsspec` `AbstractFileSystem`
- `Path`: wrapper of an `fsspec` path
- `FilePath`: specialization of a `Path` for files
- `DirectoryPath`: specialization of a `Path` for directories
- `OrganizeIt`: Top-level `pydantic` model representiing an `fsspec` directory
- `Directory`: `pydantic` model representing an `fsspec` directory
- `File`: `pydantic` model representing an `fsspec` file
